I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) working with [Prof. Kevin Grise](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/kevin-grise/).

Prior to joining UVa, I obtained my bachelor degree from the College of Atmospheric Sciences at Lanzhou University and spent my third year in Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, where I worked closely with [Prof. Keith Shine](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/keith-shine/).

Research Interest
------
I have a broad interest in our Earth's climate system, especially the interactions between large-scale atmospheric circulations and clouds and the role of mean-state biases in global climate models in affecting their future projections. My current research mainly focuses on [understanding possible mechanisms controlling variabilities of the large-scale atmospheric circulation (particularly jet streams)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JD034876) both in current climate and in response to future climate change, examining how these processes are represented in climate models and [trying to reduce unceratinty in future climate projections by developing "emergent constraint"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL104896). I'm also interested in applying machine learning and causal discovery methods to climate science.
